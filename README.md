## Installation
To install the BetterDiscord Cyan Theme, follow these steps:<br>

    Download the theme file: testMine.css
    Place the file in your BetterDiscord themes folder:
        Windows: %appdata%/BetterDiscord/themes
        Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/BetterDiscord/themes
        Linux: ~/.config/BetterDiscord/themes
    Enable the theme in BetterDiscord:
        Go to User Settings > Themes
        Find the Cyan Theme and toggle it on

## Background-image property

```
--background-image: url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denysovski/CyanTheme/main/cyan.jpg'); /* app background image (link must be HTTPS) [default: url(https://github.com/denysovski/CyanTheme/blob/main/cyan.jpg)] */
```

## How to change background image via online link?
The easiest solution to change the background image by changing url('') with the source URL of your image</br>
Be aware that when the image from online source gets deleted, you won't get to see the theme in Discord anymore.

- Find an image online and get it's source URL (For verification, make sure the ending of URL is .jpg, which leads to an image, not a website)
- Replace the background-image property url('') to your image URL

```
--background-image: url('https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/vivid-blurred-colorful-wallpaper-background_58702-3784.jpg'); /* app background image (link must be HTTPS) [default: url(https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/vivid-blurred-colorful-wallpaper-background_58702-3784.jpg)] */
```

- Save the code and upload it back to the folder - repeat steps in **Installation** part

## How to change background image via GitHub repository?
Harder and much longer way to change background image, but more efficient, because the online source can be deleted at any time, while your repository is here forever

- Upload your image to own GitHub repository of your choice (e.g. your account name "Jason", repository "JasonBack", image "CyanBack.jpg")
- Replace the link property to your own values

```
--background-image: url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jason/JasonBack/main/CyanBack.jpg'); /* app background image (link must be HTTPS) [default: url(https://github.com/Jason/JasonBack/blob/main/CyanBack.jpg)] */
```

- Save the code and upload it back to the folder - repeat steps in **Installation** part
