## Installation
To install the BetterDiscord Cyan Theme, follow these steps:<br>

    Download the theme file: testMine.css
    Place the file in your BetterDiscord themes folder:
        Windows: %appdata%/BetterDiscord/themes
        Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/BetterDiscord/themes

## How to change background image?
In case you want different background image, make sure to change the CSS background-image property to your online image source (Can be even local source, but this tutorial doesn't include guide for that)

```
--background-image: url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denysovski/CyanTheme/main/cyan.jpg'); /* app background image (link must be HTTPS) [default: url(https://github.com/denysovski/CyanTheme/blob/main/cyan.jpg)] */
```

1. Upload your image to own GitHub repository of your choice (e.g. your account name "Jason", repository "JasonBack", image "CyanBack.jpg")
2. Replace the link property to your own values

```
--background-image: url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jason/JasonBack/main/CyanBack.jpg'); /* app background image (link must be HTTPS) [default: url(https://github.com/Jason/JasonBack/blob/main/CyanBack.jpg)] */
```

3. Save the code and upload it back to the folder - repeat steps in **Installation** part
